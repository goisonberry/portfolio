## Description

This is an updated version of my porfolio from back in May 2020. You will find a much cleaner porfolio page along with contact links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. My Porfolio now features links to my porject, Alenxandria, and a few of my homeworks: Weather Dashboard, Work Calendar and Code Quiz.
